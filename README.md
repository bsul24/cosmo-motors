### CosmoMotors

CosmoMotors sells $100 million in revenue annually in the United States, with 42 dealerships located around the country, and 95 salespeople. Surprisingly, the company still uses a 30Mb shared spreadsheet to record all available vehicles, sales, customers, locations, and salespeople, but this data storage has turned out slow and somewhat inconsistent. The CTO has decided to move towards a more efficient and appropriate solution that preserves data integrity and consistency, allows faster manipulation of data, and provides a better multi-user experience, a transaction recording website with a proper database running behind. This database-driven website will record all individual vehicles sold by the company (Vehicles), its different locations (Dealerships), customers (Customers), salespeople (Salespeople), and sales (Sales). Furthermore, the CTO has stated that this adjustment is the beginning of the company’s transformation to become a data-driven company, enabling a more fitting solution for business intelligence and data analytics.
